# Intro to Python
This repository contains live coding sessions and .ipynb files used during the Intro to Python workshop taught in November and December of 2025 at IHE Delft to students in the Water and Sustainable Development master program.

## Setup
For setup, I recommend the following:
1. If you don't have one already, sign up for a [Github account](https://github.com/signup)
2. *If on windows*: [install git](https://git-scm.com/)
3. *If on windows*: install [the latest python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). On all options, say y. 
4. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
5. In VS Code, install the Python and the Jupyter extensions.
   
In the class I asked students to:

7. Create a .ipynb file in the folder where they wanted to save their code.
9. Code along.

Note:

9. When you run your Jupyter notebook for the first time, you will also have to install a kernal. When Visual Studio asks to do it, say yes!

### Troubleshooting
If starting from a blank .ipynb file, click on the `+ Code` section to add a code block.

If that code block doesn't say `Python` in the lower right corner, click on what it does say, and in `Select Language Mode` select `Python`. You will then be asked to set an environment or pick a python instance - pick the newest or pyenv. The text in the bottom corner of the codeblock should now say `Python`. 

Attempt to run the block. Most likely, Visual Studio will ask to download a kernal of some sort. Say yes.
