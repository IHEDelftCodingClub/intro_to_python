    "# Python Class 1 \n",
    "#### Session 28 November\n",
    "These are the things we worked on together during the class. I have added some comments to explain what we did. I'm using the jargon of computer programmers in these notes, hoping that it helps you learn the vocabulary.  \n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "As I said during class, a computer is a tool for doing something useful with information.\n",
    "When programming, we are trying to teach it to do something it doesn’t yet know how to do.\n",
    "This requires us to understand and communicate, **very precisely**.\n",
    "Computers do *exactly* what you tell them to do.\n",
    "They cannot read your mind. They do not handle ambiguity well.\n",
    "They will do even very stupid things that you technically told them to do, even if you “obviously” didn’t intend that.\n",
    "(Every app you use that feels “intelligent” is only that way because some human thought very hard and precisely about what exact behaviors would make it feel “intelligent”, and programmed those exact behaviors.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes: \n",
    "- If you put a `# ` in front of a line in a python Code block, that line is commented out, and will not run. You can see that commented out lines are gray in VS Code. \n",

    "## Values & Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A value or object is a piece of information. The number 42, the text “hello”, the date 27 November 2025, and the dog Fido are all objects. (Python comes with support for numbers, text, and dates, but you’d have to teach it about dogs yourself.) In Python, value and object mean the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects can be made up of other objects. For example: You can put a series of objects in a list. A date is made of a year, month, and day (all numbers). Something called a dictionary lets you associate objects with one other object each, so you can “look up” a “key” (like an English word, which is a text string) and get back the value that you previously associated with that key (like its definition, which is also text string). Fido the dog has a name (text string) and a birthday (date).\n",
    "\n",
    "Every object in a computer language has a type. The type specifies what you can do with the object, and tells the computer how to do those things. You can add two numbers together, but you can’t add two dogs together. You can ask a dog to bark, but you can’t ask a number to bark."
